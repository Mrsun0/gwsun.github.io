Profile
======
I am a graduate student majoring in computer science, engaging in research on EDA, computational geometry, and artificial intelligence throughout my university years. I have published several papers in top conferences and have corresponding patents. My main research focus is on placement and routing problems. Additionally, I am proficient in C++ and Python, with most of my code written in this language. Lastly, I have been honored with the Outstanding Graduate Award from the University of Science and Technology of China for the year 2024.
