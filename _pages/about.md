I am a graduate student at the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), where I am pursuing a major in Computer Technology. I completed my undergraduate studies at the [China University of Petroleum Beijing (CUPB)](https://www.cup.edu.cn/english/). Currently, I am conducting research under the supervision of [Prof. Hu Ding](https://hu-ding.github.io/), focusing on Electronic Design Automation (EDA), computational geometry, and artificial intelligence.

My primary research interest lies in addressing placement and routing problems within the domain of EDA. I have authored several papers published in top-tier conferences and hold patents related to my research. I am proficient in both C++ and Python, and I frequently share insights and tutorials on these programming languages through my blog.

Recently, I was honored with the Outstanding Graduate Award from USTC for the year 2024.
