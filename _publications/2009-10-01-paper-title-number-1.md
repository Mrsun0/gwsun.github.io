title: "Towards Timing-Driven Routing: An Efficient Learning Based Geometric Approach"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'As the rapid increasing of the circuits complexity,
it is urgent to develop efficient algorithmic techniques for EDA.
In this paper, we consider the routing problem which is a key
part for designing high-quality chips. In particular, we combine
both the max path length and total wirelength for modeling our
optimization objective, since the path delay often causes timing
issue that can seriously degrade the whole routing efficiency
(even if the total wirelength is small)..'
