In chip design, skew is a pivotal factor that signif-
icantly influences the overall performance for routing. A major
challenge is how to achieve an appropriate trade-off between
the total wire-length cost and skew. Selecting hub nodes is an
effective method to improve this cost-skew trade-off. In this
paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning-based method
for hub node selection, where our key idea is leveraging an
effective adaptive learning strategy. Moreover, our approach is
particularly suitable for solving large-scale routing instances. The
empirical results suggest that our method can achieve promising
performance on both small-scale and large-scale clock nets,
implying its potential practical significance in EDA.
