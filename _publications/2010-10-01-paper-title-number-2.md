collection: Under-review

excerpt: 'In chip design, skew is a pivotal factor that significantly influences the overall performance for routing. A major challenge is how to achieve an appropriate trade-off between the total wire-length cost and skew. In particular, most of existing approaches often need to restrict the routing solution with some fixed topology that could cause relatively large wire-length. In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning based method that can achieve better cost-skew tradeoff, where our key idea is leveraging an effective adaptive learning strategy to break the restrictive-topology constraint. Moreover, our approach is particularly suitable for solving large-scale routing instances. The empirical results suggest that our method can achieve promising performance on both small-scale and largescale clock nets, implying its potential practical significance in EDA.'
